The quality and delicacy of the pop up and illustrations is top notch, although one page upon opening the book gently for the first time had the pop up base ripped off :( it is an unabridged version and a great book for any age to read, however If it’s for a younger age child like a toddler, best to read for them and not let them grab it as it’s very delicate and will most likely destroy the book. This book makes me happy.                </td><td>December 4, 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td><td>4.0 out of 5 stars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         </td><td>Watson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr>\n",

When I did It came completely destroyed the cover is barely on and when I contacted the seller they told me to send it to some address not do an amazon return so I ended up being stuck with it. We still read it’s just disappointing that it came damaged and we couldn’t get it fixed.

The quality and delicacy of the pop up and illustrations is top notch, although one page upon opening the book gently for the first time had the pop up base ripped off :( it is an unabridged version and a great book for any age to read, however If it’s for a younger age child like a toddler, best to read for them and not let them grab it as it’s very delicate and will most likely destroy the book.

       "| This book is absolutely amazing. The quality and delicacy of the pop up and illustrations is top notch, although one page upon opening the book gently for the first time had the pop up base ripped off :( it is an unabridged version and a great book for any age to read, however If it’s for a younger age child like a toddler, best to read for them and not let them grab it as it’s very delicate and will most likely destroy the book. This book makes me happy.                 | December 4, 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 4.0 out of 5 stars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Watson                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n",

       "3 I saw the French edition for the first time in the gift shop at the \"Louvre\", went on Amazon immediately, found the English edition, it's better priced than the museum gift shop and I didn't have to add to my luggage! It's a WIN, WIN, WIN.Great execution of the popups, they interesting, smooth, no snags, I'd recommend this for gifts for all ages (including yourself)!                                                                                                          \n",
       "4 The pop-up art in this version of \"The Little Prince\" is really well made and great quality. Just be careful with handling the book because pop-ups have a tendency to break or rip if mishandled. It doesn't distract from the elements of the story at all, as a matter fact, I think it adds more of an interactive perspective to the reader! You'll love this unabridged version of \"The Little Prince\", it's really worth it!                                                        \n",

       "\t<tr><td>The pop-up art in this version of \"The Little Prince\" is really well made and great quality. Just be careful with handling the book because pop-ups have a tendency to break or rip if mishandled. It doesn't distract from the elements of the story at all, as a matter fact, I think it adds more of an interactive perspective to the reader!

       "\t The pop-up art in this version of \"The Little Prince\" is really well made and great quality. Just be careful with handling the book because pop-ups have a tendency to break or rip if mishandled. It doesn't distract from the elements of the story at all, as a matter fact, I think it adds more of an interactive perspective to the reader!

So my five tars is for the book it’s self it’s a joy and truely enjoyable. | March 17, 2019                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 5.0 out of 5 stars                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Dmbait                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

       "| The pop-up art in this version of \"The Little Prince\" is really well made and great quality.

When I did It came completely destroyed the cover is barely on and when I contacted the seller they told me to send it to some address not do an amazon return so I ended up being stuck with it. We still read it’s just disappointing that it came damaged and we couldn’t get it fixed. So my five tars is for the book it’s self it’s a joy and truely enjoyable.\n",
